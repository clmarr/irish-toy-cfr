$Proto-Irish to Old Irish cascade!

$although this language treats nasal stops as proper stops and [-cont] that's a change to symbolDefs I'm too lazy to implement at the moment, so we are instead handling that distinction with length. Implementing long variant default. Implement the same for l and r since it seems to work the same. 
[+son,+cons] > [+long]

$First Lenition: stops spirantize and sonorants "shorten" intervocalically. s to h in these contexts too. 
{[-cont];[+son];s} > {[+cont];[+long];h} / [-cons] __ [+syl] 

$lenition of s to h in also # __ V where the V is not stressed. 
s > h / # __ [-stres]

$loss of post-non-consonantal final consonants
[+cons] > ∅ / [-cons] __ #

$*w merges into β
w > β

$post-sonorant stop voicing in clusters. Bled by spirantization in first lenition (finchar). 
[-cont] > [+voi] / [+son] __

$compensatory lenthening before nasal deletion for stressed vowels
[+stres] > [+long] / __ [+nas,+cons] [-son] 

$loss of N in V __ C
[+nas,+cons] > ∅ / [-cons] __ [+cons,-nas]
